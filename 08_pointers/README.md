#### Pointers

- How do you get the memory address of a variable?
```
Pointers reference a location in memory where a value is stored rather than the value itself
```

- How do you assign a value to a pointer?
```go
 *pointer = 10
```

- How do you create a new pointer?
```go
pointer := new(int)
```

- What is the value of x after running this program:
```
value.go
```

- Write a program that can swap two integers (x := 1; y := 2; swap(&x, &y) should give you x=2 and y=1).
```
swapper.go
```
