#### Variables

- What are two ways to create a new variable?
```
var x = "something"
x := "something"
```

- What is the value of x after running:
x := 5; x += 1?
```
value.go
```

- What is scope and how do you determine the scope of a variable in Go?
```
the variable exists within the nearest curly braces { } (a block) including any nested curly braces (blocks), but not outside of them
```

- What is the difference between var and const?
```
Constants are variables whose values cannot be changed later
```

- Using the example program as a starting point, write a program that converts from Fahrenheit into Celsius. (C = (F - 32) * 5/9)
```
temp.go
```

- Write another program that converts from feet into meters. (1 ft = 0.3048 m)
```
length.go
```
