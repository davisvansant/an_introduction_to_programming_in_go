#### Arrays, Slices, Maps

- How do you access the 4th element of an array or slice?
```
fourth.go
```

- What is the length of a slice created using: make([]int, 3, 9)?
```
length.go
```

- Given the array:

 `x := [6]string{"a","b","c","d","e","f"}`

 what would x[2:5] give you?
```
two_to_five.go
```

- Write a program that finds the smallest number in this list:

  ```
  x := []int{
    48,96,86,68,
    57,82,63,70,
    37,34,83,27,
    19,97, 9,17,
  }
  ```

  ```
  smallest.go
  ```
